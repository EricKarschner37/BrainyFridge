According to a study conducted by the UN, 30% of produce worldwide is wasted every year. A large portion of that is due to the expiration of already purchased goods. This application attempts to combat that by notifying users of their expiring items before they are no longer good for consumption.

Features

*Users receive a notification the day before and the day that their items expire
*The Recipes page automatically finds recipes that use the ingredients that will expire soonest, to assist the user in getting rid of those items.
